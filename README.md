- Sementic HTML5
  - The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is.

- Media Queries
  - To target different devices to adjust layout accordingly
  
- CSS (BEM)
  - There are plenty of methodologies out there aiming to reduce the CSS footprint, organize cooperation among programmers and maintain large CSS codebases
  
- jQuery/JavaScript
  - Full page section slides down on mousewheel
